# Calculator
This project builds a simple calculator in Elixir using independent processes.

Additional description about the project and its features.

## Built With

- Elixir
- VS code

## Getting Started

**Run the code demonstrations below**

*for the spawn approach use*

```bash
iex -S mix
pid=Calculator.start
```

The following commands will depend with what you want to do

if you want to add run
```bash
Calculator.add(pid, value)
```

if you want to substract run
```bash
Calculator.substract(pid, value)
```

if you want to divide run
```bash
Calculator.divide(pid, value)
```

if you want to multiply run
```bash
Calculator.multiply(pid, value)
```
if you want to check the cuurent value run
```bash
Calculator.value(pid)
```

*for the GenServer approach run*

```bash
Supervisor.Calculator.start_link
```
*The function for the mathematical operator are the same, just replace Calculator with Gen.Calculator*
*and when running the function ommit the pid.*
for example, for addition run 
```bash
Gen.Calculator.add(value)
```
*and follow the same pattern for the other operators*

Note that value is a custom number that you will enter
